### Reduction of the data

1. According to https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14248/figures/4
State E015 is the quiesent state (low state) which do not have signal for any of the
histone marks ChIPed in the experiment. Those regions can be functional (just do not enrich
the histone marks we tested, but other histone marks could exist), but we can not get
information out of it. **If E015 is present in the same bin across all samples, those can be filtered
out.**

2.  If the same state is present in the same bin across all samples, those do not give information
to differentiate subgroups of samples. These regions can be filtered out.

3.  If the same conbination of states across samples is present across multiple bins, only one bin need to
be retained. (this may not be true in biology settings, different bin can be of different importance for the genome).

I will be doing 1 and 2.
