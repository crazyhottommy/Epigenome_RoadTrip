### last day in PNNL

some thoughts:

1. rerun chromHMM for epigenome Roadmap data with 1 kb bin. Then use our feature selection method.
with 200bp bin size, there are over 5 million features across genome, it is hard to work with.
with 1 kb bin size, it is around 1 million features.

2. We can only focus on certain states only. Let's say we only want the bins that showed state E2 in
any of the samples. This can reduce the feature numbers.

3. Roadmap data is still good to test whether our feature selection method worked or not. Because we selected
quite different tissue types, we are sure there exist some features that can differetiate the tissue types.

4. we can then apply the method to our tumor data again.
