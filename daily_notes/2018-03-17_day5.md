### some thoughts

Depending on the purpose of the study, one can further combine similar chromatin state together.

e.g. low state, artifacts state, active state and repressive state.

or maybe in the model, one can specify which states are more close to each other, which states are opposite to each other?

For our own in-house tumor data set, accoding to the chromHMM state call, E3 and E16 are both low state calls. we can replace all E16 to E3.

need to combine states before the merging, filtering steps for our data.

### run epilogos

I spent the weekend writing a snakemake workflow for running epilogos: https://github.com/crazyhottommy/pyflow-epilogos
